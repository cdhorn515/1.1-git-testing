# Git testing

Used this repo to test changing a GitHub repository name to see what happened with the GitHub pages link.

After changing the repo name, the GH-pages link was updated to the new repository name automatically.

Also, link to original repo code [https://github.com/cdhorn515/1.1-git-testing](https://github.com/cdhorn515/1.1-git-testing) will redirect 
to new repo name.
